Text Generation Model
Moonshot's text generation model (referred to as moonshot-v1) is trained to understand both natural and written language. It can generate text output based on the input provided. The input to the model is also known as a "prompt." We generally recommend that you provide clear instructions and some examples to enable the model to complete the intended task. Designing a prompt is essentially learning how to "train" the model. The moonshot-v1 model can be used for a variety of tasks, including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, and creative writing.
